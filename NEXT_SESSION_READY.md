### 3. **Feature Development Start** (Remaining time)
Begin Phase 1 of development roadmap:

#### **Enhanced Voice Commands (v1.1.0)**
- [ ] Design command processing architecture
- [ ] Implement voice command parser
- [ ] Create built-in command library
- [ ] Add application integration features

**Priority Commands to Implement**:
```python
INITIAL_COMMANDS = [
    "open browser" → Launch default browser
    "take screenshot" → Capture screen
    "lock screen" → Lock the desktop
    "open terminal" → Launch terminal
    "switch to [app]" → Focus application window
    "new tab" → Ctrl+T (in browser)
    "save file" → Ctrl+S
    "copy selection" → Ctrl+C
]
```

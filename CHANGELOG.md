## Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **Modular Design** - Separated core functionality from UI components
- **Error-First Approach** - Comprehensive error handling from the start
- **Production Readiness** - Built for stability and reliability
- **Community Focus** - Designed for easy contribution and maintenance

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading** - Models loaded on demand
- **Resource Monitoring** - Automatic cleanup and memory management
- **Efficient Audio Processing** - Optimized for real-time performance
- **Background Processing** - Non-blocking UI operations

### Security Considerations
- **Local Processing** - No data sent to external servers
- **Minimal Permissions** - Runs with user-level privileges
- **Secure Storage** - Configuration files with appropriate permissions
- **Privacy Compliance** - No voice data storage or logging

# Voice Control Project - Kiro Context File

## Project Overview

This is a completely rebranded and modernized Linux voice control application that provides offline speech-to-text functionality. Originally inspired by open-source voice control projects, it has been completely transformed into a modern, stable solution powered exclusively by Mistral's Voxtral Speech AI model.

## Current State

### What We've Accomplished
- **Modernized Architecture**: Implemented a structured codebase with separate modules for audio, core, and GUI components
- **Enhanced GUI**: Created a modern interface with system tray integration (evidence from compiled .pyc files)
- **System Integration**: Implemented auto-start functionality and desktop integration
- **Input Handling**: Enhanced mouse cursor awareness and clipboard operations

### Current Technology Stack
- **Speech Recognition**: Exclusively using Mistral's Voxtral Speech AI
- **GUI Framework**: Tkinter with modern styling
- **Audio Processing**: Custom audio management and noise reduction
- **System Integration**: User-space systemd services, desktop autostart, system tray
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and resource management
- **License**: MIT License with maximum freedom

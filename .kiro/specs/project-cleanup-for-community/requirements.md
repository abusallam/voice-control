# Project Cleanup for Linux Community Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines requirements for cleaning up the voice control project to make it ready for contribution to the Linux community. The project currently has incomplete Voxtral integration attempts and needs to be streamlined to focus on what works reliably while removing experimental code that doesn't function properly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Remove Non-Functional Voxtral Integration

**User Story:** As a Linux user, I want a voice control application that works reliably without broken features, so that I can use it confidently for daily tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing the application THEN users SHALL NOT encounter errors from incomplete Voxtral integration
2. WHEN running tests THEN all test files SHALL pass or be removed if non-functional
3. WHEN using the application THEN users SHALL NOT see error messages about missing Voxtral dependencies
4. WHEN reviewing the code THEN there SHALL be no incomplete or experimental Voxtral code that doesn't work
5. WHEN reading documentation THEN there SHALL be no references to non-functional Voxtral features

### Requirement 2: Focus on Working Speech Recognition

**User Story:** As a Linux user, I want reliable speech recognition that works out of the box, so that I can start using voice control immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring speech recognition THEN the system SHALL use proven, working backends only
2. WHEN processing audio THEN the system SHALL use stable speech recognition libraries
3. WHEN users install the application THEN they SHALL get working speech recognition without complex setup
4. WHEN speech recognition fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear fallback options
5. WHEN documenting features THEN only tested and working speech recognition methods SHALL be mentioned

### Requirement 3: Clean Project Structure

**User Story:** As a developer contributing to the project, I want a clean and organized codebase, so that I can understand and contribute effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exploring the project THEN the directory structure SHALL be logical and well-organized
2. WHEN reading code THEN there SHALL be no unused imports or dead code
3. WHEN reviewing files THEN there SHALL be no experimental virtual environments or temporary files
4. WHEN checking dependencies THEN requirements.txt SHALL contain only necessary packages
5. WHEN examining the codebase THEN there SHALL be consistent coding standards throughout

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Documentation

**User Story:** As a Linux user, I want clear documentation that helps me install and use the voice control system, so that I can get started quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading the README THEN users SHALL understand what the project does and how to install it
2. WHEN following installation instructions THEN users SHALL be able to install successfully on major Linux distributions
3. WHEN configuring the system THEN users SHALL have clear guidance on available options
4. WHEN troubleshooting THEN users SHALL find helpful solutions for common issues
5. WHEN contributing THEN developers SHALL have clear guidelines for code contributions

### Requirement 5: Reliable Installation Process

**User Story:** As a Linux user, I want a simple installation process that works on my distribution, so that I can start using voice control without technical difficulties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the install script THEN it SHALL work on Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and Arch Linux
2. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL handle package management appropriately for each distribution
3. WHEN setting up services THEN the installation SHALL use user-space services that don't require root
4. WHEN verifying installation THEN users SHALL have tools to test that everything works correctly
5. WHEN uninstalling THEN users SHALL be able to completely remove the application and its components

### Requirement 6: Working Test Suite

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive test suite that validates the application works correctly, so that I can contribute with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN all test files SHALL execute successfully
2. WHEN testing core functionality THEN speech recognition, system integration, and GUI components SHALL be validated
3. WHEN testing on different systems THEN tests SHALL account for various Linux distributions and desktop environments
4. WHEN adding new features THEN developers SHALL have examples of how to write appropriate tests
5. WHEN running continuous integration THEN tests SHALL provide reliable feedback about code quality

### Requirement 7: Community-Ready Licensing and Contribution Guidelines

**User Story:** As a potential contributor, I want clear licensing and contribution guidelines, so that I know how I can help improve the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the license THEN it SHALL be appropriate for open source community contribution
2. WHEN wanting to contribute THEN developers SHALL find clear guidelines for code style, testing, and submission
3. WHEN submitting issues THEN users SHALL have templates that help them provide useful information
4. WHEN reviewing pull requests THEN maintainers SHALL have clear criteria for acceptance
5. WHEN using the project commercially THEN the license SHALL allow appropriate usage

### Requirement 8: Performance and Resource Optimization

**User Story:** As a Linux user, I want voice control that doesn't consume excessive system resources, so that it doesn't impact my other work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running voice control THEN it SHALL use reasonable amounts of CPU and memory
2. WHEN idle THEN the application SHALL have minimal resource footprint
3. WHEN processing audio THEN the system SHALL be optimized for real-time performance
4. WHEN running on older hardware THEN the application SHALL still function acceptably
5. WHEN monitoring resources THEN users SHALL have tools to understand system impact

### Requirement 9: Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious Linux user, I want voice control that respects my privacy and security, so that I can use it without concerns about data leakage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing audio THEN all processing SHALL happen locally without network transmission
2. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use appropriate file permissions and secure storage
3. WHEN running services THEN they SHALL operate in user space without requiring elevated privileges
4. WHEN handling sensitive information THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate protections
5. WHEN documenting privacy THEN users SHALL understand exactly what data is processed and how

### Requirement 10: Cross-Desktop Environment Compatibility

**User Story:** As a Linux user on any desktop environment, I want voice control that works with my setup, so that I don't need to change my preferred environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using GNOME THEN voice control SHALL integrate properly with the desktop
2. WHEN using KDE THEN voice control SHALL work with Plasma desktop features
3. WHEN using XFCE THEN voice control SHALL function with lightweight desktop requirements
4. WHEN using Wayland THEN voice control SHALL work with modern display server protocols
5. WHEN using X11 THEN voice control SHALL maintain compatibility with traditional X Window System

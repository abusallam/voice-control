# Voxtral Integration Fixes Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines requirements for fixing the Voxtral Speech AI integration in the voice control application. The current implementation incorrectly attempts to use Voxtral through Hugging Face transformers, but Voxtral is actually available through two proper methods: Mistral's hosted API and local deployment with vLLM.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Correct Voxtral Integration Architecture

**User Story:** As a user, I want the voice control application to properly integrate with Voxtral Speech AI using the correct API methods, so that I can benefit from Mistral's advanced speech recognition capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring Voxtral THEN the system SHALL support both Mistral API and local vLLM deployment options
2. WHEN using Mistral API THEN the system SHALL authenticate with API keys and use the transcription endpoint
3. WHEN using local vLLM THEN the system SHALL connect to a locally hosted Voxtral Mini 3B model
4. WHEN Voxtral is unavailable THEN the system SHALL automatically fallback to Whisper
5. WHEN switching between API and local modes THEN the system SHALL handle configuration changes gracefully

### Requirement 2: Mistral API Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use Mistral's hosted Voxtral API for speech recognition, so that I can get high-quality transcription without running models locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Mistral API THEN the system SHALL authenticate using MISTRAL_API_KEY environment variable
2. WHEN sending audio THEN the system SHALL use the audio transcription endpoint with proper formatting
3. WHEN processing responses THEN the system SHALL handle both text and timestamped transcription formats
4. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry logic with exponential backoff
5. WHEN API quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to local alternatives

### Requirement 3: Local vLLM Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the option to run Voxtral locally using vLLM, so that I can have completely offline speech recognition with privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using local vLLM THEN the system SHALL connect to a local vLLM server endpoint
2. WHEN vLLM server is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options
3. WHEN processing audio locally THEN the system SHALL use OpenAI-compatible API format
4. WHEN local resources are insufficient THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust model parameters
5. WHEN local deployment fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to Mistral API or Whisper

### Requirement 4: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want easy configuration options to choose between different Voxtral deployment methods, so that I can select the best option for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN users SHALL be able to choose between API, local, and fallback-only modes
2. WHEN using API mode THEN the system SHALL validate API keys and endpoint connectivity
3. WHEN using local mode THEN the system SHALL validate vLLM server availability
4. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance for fixing issues
5. WHEN switching modes THEN the system SHALL preserve other user settings and preferences

### Requirement 5: Audio Format Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle various audio formats properly for Voxtral processing, so that I don't need to worry about audio conversion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing audio THEN the system SHALL support MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC, and OGG formats
2. WHEN audio format is unsupported THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic conversion
3. WHEN audio is too long THEN the system SHALL split it into appropriate chunks
4. WHEN audio quality is poor THEN the system SHALL apply preprocessing to improve recognition
5. WHEN audio processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages

### Requirement 6: Performance and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want Voxtral integration to be efficient and not impact system performance, so that voice control remains responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using API mode THEN the system SHALL implement request queuing to avoid rate limits
2. WHEN using local mode THEN the system SHALL monitor resource usage and adjust accordingly
3. WHEN processing multiple requests THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently without blocking
4. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement cleanup procedures
5. WHEN network is slow THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate timeouts and fallbacks

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages and diagnostic information when Voxtral integration issues occur, so that I can troubleshoot problems effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance for API key setup
2. WHEN local server is unreachable THEN the system SHALL suggest vLLM server startup procedures
3. WHEN audio processing fails THEN the system SHALL indicate whether the issue is format, size, or quality related
4. WHEN fallback occurs THEN the system SHALL log the reason and notify the user
5. WHEN diagnostics are requested THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive status information

### Requirement 8: Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want confidence that Voxtral integration is working correctly, so that I can rely on the voice control system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL validate both API and local integration methods
2. WHEN testing API mode THEN the system SHALL verify authentication and basic transcription
3. WHEN testing local mode THEN the system SHALL verify vLLM connectivity and model availability
4. WHEN testing fallbacks THEN the system SHALL ensure graceful degradation works properly
5. WHEN performance testing THEN the system SHALL measure and report transcription speed and accuracy

### Requirement 9: Documentation and User Guidance

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear documentation on how to set up and use Voxtral integration, so that I can configure it properly for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up API mode THEN users SHALL have clear instructions for obtaining and configuring API keys
2. WHEN setting up local mode THEN users SHALL have step-by-step vLLM installation and configuration guides
3. WHEN troubleshooting THEN users SHALL have access to common issues and solutions
4. WHEN comparing options THEN users SHALL understand the trade-offs between API and local deployment
5. WHEN updating configuration THEN users SHALL have guidance on migration and best practices

### Requirement 10: Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a user, I want Voxtral integration to handle my audio data securely and respect my privacy preferences, so that I can use voice control with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using API mode THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate that audio is sent to Mistral's servers
2. WHEN using local mode THEN the system SHALL ensure audio never leaves the local machine
3. WHEN storing API keys THEN the system SHALL use secure storage methods
4. WHEN logging audio data THEN the system SHALL respect privacy settings and avoid sensitive information
5. WHEN user requests data deletion THEN the system SHALL provide clear procedures for cleanup

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for comprehensive testing of the voice control system tray functionality on the current PC. The system tray is a critical component that provides persistent access to voice control features without interfering with the user's workflow. This testing spec ensures the system tray works reliably across different desktop environments, handles edge cases gracefully, and provides an intuitive user experience.

The testing will validate both the existing implementation and identify any issues that need to be addressed for optimal system tray integration on Linux desktop environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: System Tray Icon Visibility and Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want the voice control system tray icon to be consistently visible and accessible in my system tray, so that I can always control the application without searching for it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the voice control application starts THEN the system tray icon SHALL appear in the system tray within 5 seconds
2. WHEN the system tray icon is displayed THEN it SHALL remain visible and not disappear during normal operation
3. WHEN the desktop environment is changed or restarted THEN the system tray icon SHALL reappear automatically
4. WHEN other applications are maximized or in fullscreen THEN the system tray icon SHALL remain accessible
5. WHEN the user hovers over the system tray icon THEN a tooltip SHALL display the current status

### Requirement 2: System Tray Menu Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access voice control features through a right-click context menu on the system tray icon, so that I can control the application without opening additional windows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user right-clicks the system tray icon THEN a context menu SHALL appear with all available options
2. WHEN the user clicks "Start Listening" THEN voice recognition SHALL begin and the menu option SHALL change to indicate listening state
3. WHEN the user clicks "Stop Listening" THEN voice recognition SHALL stop and the menu SHALL update accordingly
4. WHEN the user clicks "Settings" THEN the configuration window SHALL open
5. WHEN the user clicks "Status" THEN the status window SHALL display current system information
6. WHEN the user clicks "Exit" THEN the application SHALL shut down gracefully

### Requirement 3: Visual Status Indicators

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system tray icon to visually indicate the current state of voice recognition, so that I can quickly see whether the system is listening or idle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN voice recognition is idle THEN the system tray icon SHALL display a gray microphone icon
2. WHEN voice recognition is active THEN the system tray icon SHALL display a red microphone icon
3. WHEN there is an error state THEN the system tray icon SHALL display a warning indicator
4. WHEN the application is starting up THEN the system tray icon SHALL show a loading indicator
5. WHEN the tooltip is displayed THEN it SHALL accurately reflect the current operational state

### Requirement 4: Desktop Environment Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user running different Linux desktop environments, I want the system tray to work consistently regardless of my desktop choice, so that I have a reliable experience across different systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on GNOME desktop THEN the system tray SHALL function with all features available
2. WHEN running on KDE Plasma desktop THEN the system tray SHALL integrate properly with the panel
3. WHEN running on XFCE desktop THEN the system tray SHALL appear in the notification area
4. WHEN running on other desktop environments THEN the system tray SHALL gracefully fallback to available alternatives
5. WHEN no system tray is available THEN the application SHALL provide alternative access methods

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system tray to handle errors gracefully and recover from issues automatically, so that I don't lose access to voice control functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system tray disappears unexpectedly THEN it SHALL automatically attempt to recreate itself
2. WHEN GUI framework dependencies are missing THEN the application SHALL fallback to alternative interfaces
3. WHEN system tray operations fail THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be logged
4. WHEN the desktop environment crashes THEN the system tray SHALL recover when the environment restarts
5. WHEN there are permission issues THEN the user SHALL be notified with clear instructions

### Requirement 6: Performance and Resource Usage

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system tray to be lightweight and not impact system performance, so that it doesn't slow down my computer or consume excessive resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system tray is running THEN it SHALL use less than 50MB of RAM
2. WHEN the system tray is idle THEN it SHALL use less than 1% CPU
3. WHEN the context menu is opened THEN it SHALL respond within 200ms
4. WHEN switching between states THEN icon updates SHALL occur within 100ms
5. WHEN the application runs for extended periods THEN memory usage SHALL remain stable without leaks

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the existing voice control application to make it more user-friendly, feature-rich, and easier to deploy on Debian 12 with GNOME. The enhancements focus on improving the user experience, adding modern features, and streamlining the installation and configuration process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Reliable Auto-Start and System Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the voice control application to automatically start when I boot my machine and remain accessible through the system tray, so that I can control it easily without it interfering with other applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system boots THEN the voice control application SHALL automatically start and minimize to system tray
2. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL create a persistent system tray icon with start/stop controls
3. WHEN other applications are in focus THEN the voice control SHALL remain accessible without coming to foreground
4. WHEN the user clicks the system tray icon THEN they SHALL see options to start/stop voice recognition and access settings
5. WHEN the application encounters errors THEN it SHALL show notifications through the system tray without disrupting workflow

### Requirement 2: Modern GUI with Dark Mode Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want a modern, intuitive interface with dark mode support and better visual feedback, so that the application feels contemporary and is comfortable to use in different lighting conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the settings GUI THEN the system SHALL display a modern interface with proper spacing and typography
2. WHEN the system detects dark mode preference THEN the application SHALL automatically use dark theme
3. WHEN voice recognition is active THEN the system SHALL show clear visual indicators with animations
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with suggested solutions
5. WHEN the user configures settings THEN the system SHALL provide real-time validation and feedback

### Requirement 3: Advanced Voice Commands and Macros

**User Story:** As a power user, I want to create custom voice commands and macros that can execute complex actions, so that I can automate repetitive tasks and improve my productivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user says a custom command THEN the system SHALL execute the associated macro or script
2. WHEN creating macros THEN the system SHALL provide a GUI editor with syntax highlighting
3. WHEN voice commands are recognized THEN the system SHALL support context-aware commands based on active application
4. WHEN multiple commands are chained THEN the system SHALL execute them in sequence with proper timing
5. WHEN commands conflict THEN the system SHALL provide disambiguation options

### Requirement 4: Improved Audio Processing and Noise Handling

**User Story:** As a user in various environments, I want the voice recognition to work reliably even with background noise and different microphone setups, so that I can use the application in real-world conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN background noise is present THEN the system SHALL filter noise before processing speech
2. WHEN multiple audio devices are available THEN the system SHALL allow easy selection and switching
3. WHEN audio levels are too low or high THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback and auto-adjustment options
4. WHEN speech recognition confidence is low THEN the system SHALL request confirmation before executing commands
5. WHEN the microphone is not working THEN the system SHALL provide clear diagnostic information

### Requirement 5: Multi-Language Support and Localization

**User Story:** As a non-English speaker, I want to use voice control in my native language with proper localization, so that the application is accessible and usable for international users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a language THEN the system SHALL download and configure appropriate language models
2. WHEN using non-English languages THEN the system SHALL properly handle accents and regional variations
3. WHEN the interface loads THEN all UI elements SHALL be translated to the selected language
4. WHEN voice commands are processed THEN the system SHALL use language-specific text processing rules
5. WHEN switching languages THEN the system SHALL maintain user preferences and custom configurations

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Input Control and Mouse Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the voice control to work seamlessly with mouse cursor positioning and provide reliable text input and clipboard functionality, so that I can control my computer naturally without input conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I say voice commands THEN the system SHALL execute actions at the current mouse cursor position when relevant
2. WHEN typing text via voice THEN the system SHALL insert text at the current cursor position in any application
3. WHEN using clipboard commands THEN the system SHALL reliably copy, cut, and paste content without conflicts
4. WHEN the mouse cursor moves THEN the voice control SHALL adapt its context to the element under the cursor
5. WHEN voice commands involve clicking THEN the system SHALL perform clicks at the precise cursor location

### Requirement 7: System Integration and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the voice control to integrate seamlessly with system accessibility features and provide comprehensive control over my desktop environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessibility features are enabled THEN the voice control SHALL work alongside screen readers and other assistive technologies
2. WHEN controlling applications THEN the system SHALL support window management, application switching, and menu navigation
3. WHEN typing text THEN the system SHALL support cursor positioning, text selection, and editing commands
4. WHEN using system functions THEN the system SHALL provide voice control for volume, brightness, and other system settings
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide audio feedback in addition to visual notifications

### Requirement 8: Performance Monitoring and Analytics

**User Story:** As a user, I want to monitor the performance and accuracy of voice recognition to optimize my setup and understand usage patterns, so that I can improve my experience over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN voice recognition occurs THEN the system SHALL track accuracy metrics and response times
2. WHEN the user requests statistics THEN the system SHALL display usage analytics and performance trends
3. WHEN recognition errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them for analysis and improvement
4. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL provide performance optimization suggestions
5. WHEN models are updated THEN the system SHALL compare performance before and after updates

### Requirement 9: Cloud Integration and Backup

**User Story:** As a user with multiple devices, I want to sync my voice control settings and custom commands across devices, so that I have a consistent experience regardless of which computer I'm using.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enables cloud sync THEN the system SHALL backup settings and custom configurations
2. WHEN setting up on a new device THEN the system SHALL restore previous configurations from cloud storage
3. WHEN custom commands are created THEN the system SHALL sync them across all connected devices
4. WHEN conflicts occur during sync THEN the system SHALL provide merge options and conflict resolution
5. WHEN privacy is a concern THEN the system SHALL offer local-only operation without cloud features

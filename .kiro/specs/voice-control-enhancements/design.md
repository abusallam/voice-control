# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the architecture and implementation approach for fixing critical issues with the existing voice control application and enhancing its reliability. The primary focus is on resolving auto-start problems, improving system tray integration, fixing mouse cursor and input issues, and ensuring the application works seamlessly without interfering with other applications.

The design prioritizes immediate fixes for user-reported issues while maintaining the core functionality. Key improvements include reliable auto-start mechanisms, persistent system tray presence, enhanced input handling, and better desktop integration to prevent the application from going behind other windows.

### Priority Component Architecture

The application will be enhanced with focus on critical fixes:

1. **System Tray Integration** (`voice_control/gui/system_tray.py`): Persistent system tray with start/stop controls
2. **Auto-Start Manager** (`voice_control/system/autostart.py`): Reliable boot-time startup mechanisms
3. **Enhanced Input Handler** (`voice_control/system/input_handler.py`): Mouse cursor-aware input processing
4. **Desktop Integration** (`voice_control/system/desktop.py`): Window management and focus handling
5. **Core Engine** (`voice_control/core/engine.py`): Central coordination and state management
6. **Configuration Manager** (`voice_control/core/config.py`): Settings persistence and migration

## Critical Issue Solutions

### Auto-Start Reliability

**Problem**: Application doesn't start automatically after machine restart.

**Solution Architecture**:
- Multiple auto-start mechanisms for redundancy
- Systemd user service for reliable startup
- Desktop autostart entry as fallback
- Boot delay handling to ensure system readiness
- Startup verification and self-healing

**Implementation**:
```python
class AutoStartManager:
    def setup_autostart(self) -> bool
    def create_systemd_service(self) -> bool
    def create_desktop_autostart(self) -> bool
    def verify_autostart_working(self) -> bool
    def repair_autostart(self) -> bool
```

### System Tray Integration

**Problem**: Application goes behind other windows and lacks easy control.

**Solution Architecture**:
- Persistent system tray icon that never disappears
- Right-click context menu with start/stop/settings options
- Visual indicators for listening state
- Notification system for status updates
- Always-on-top option for settings window

**Implementation**:
```python
class SystemTrayManager:
    def create_tray_icon(self) -> None

    def handle_tray_click(self, event) -> None
    def send_notification(self, message: str) -> None
```

### Enhanced Input Processing

**Problem**: Mouse cursor positioning and clipboard functionality issues.

**Solution Architecture**:
- Cursor position tracking and context awareness
- Reliable clipboard operations with error handling
- Input method detection (X11/Wayland)

**Implementation**:
```python
class EnhancedInputHandler:
    def get_cursor_position(self) -> Tuple[int, int]

# Enhanced Voice Commands Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines requirements for enhancing the Voice Control for Linux application with intelligent command processing beyond simple dictation. The current system successfully performs speech-to-text conversion, and now we need to add smart command recognition and execution capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Command Processing System

**User Story:** As a Linux user, I want to execute specific commands by voice beyond simple dictation, so that I can control my computer more efficiently through voice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I say "open browser" THEN the system SHALL launch the default web browser
2. WHEN I say "take screenshot" THEN the system SHALL capture the screen and save it
3. WHEN I say "lock screen" THEN the system SHALL lock the desktop session
4. WHEN I say "open terminal" THEN the system SHALL launch the default terminal application
5. WHEN I say an unrecognized command THEN the system SHALL fall back to typing the text

### Requirement 2: Application Context Awareness

**User Story:** As a user working in different applications, I want voice commands that work appropriately for the current application context, so that commands are more intelligent and useful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I'm in a web browser and say "new tab" THEN the system SHALL execute Ctrl+T
2. WHEN I'm in any application and say "save file" THEN the system SHALL execute Ctrl+S
3. WHEN I'm in a text editor and say "select all" THEN the system SHALL execute Ctrl+A
4. WHEN I say "switch to [application]" THEN the system SHALL focus that application window
5. WHEN the target application is not running THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback

### Requirement 3: Command Confirmation and Safety

**User Story:** As a user, I want potentially destructive commands to require confirmation, so that I don't accidentally execute dangerous operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I say "lock screen" THEN the system SHALL ask for confirmation before executing
2. WHEN I say "close application" THEN the system SHALL ask for confirmation before executing
3. WHEN I confirm a command THEN the system SHALL execute it immediately
4. WHEN I cancel a command THEN the system SHALL abort the operation and provide feedback
5. WHEN a command fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error information

### Requirement 4: Fuzzy Command Matching

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to understand variations in how I phrase commands, so that I don't have to remember exact trigger phrases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I say "open browser" or "launch browser" or "start browser" THEN the system SHALL recognize all as the same command
2. WHEN I say "screenshot" or "take screenshot" or "capture screen" THEN the system SHALL recognize all as the same command
3. WHEN I say a command with slight variations THEN the system SHALL use fuzzy matching to find the best match
4. WHEN multiple commands match equally THEN the system SHALL ask for clarification
5. WHEN no command matches well THEN the system SHALL fall back to dictation mode

### Requirement 5: Command History and Learning

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to remember my frequently used commands and learn from my usage patterns, so that recognition improves over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use a command THEN the system SHALL record it in command history
2. WHEN I frequently use certain commands THEN the system SHALL prioritize them in matching
3. WHEN I view command history THEN I SHALL see my recent voice commands and their results
4. WHEN I repeat a recent command THEN the system SHALL recognize it faster
5. WHEN I clear history THEN the system SHALL remove all stored command data

### Requirement 6: Visual Command Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see what command was recognized and its status, so that I have clear feedback about what the system is doing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a command is recognized THEN the system SHALL display the command name in the system tray
2. WHEN a command is executing THEN the system SHALL show a progress indicator
3. WHEN a command completes successfully THEN the system SHALL show a success notification
4. WHEN a command fails THEN the system SHALL show an error notification with details
5. WHEN I hover over the system tray THEN I SHALL see the last executed command

### Requirement 7: Custom Command Creation

**User Story:** As a power user, I want to create my own custom voice commands, so that I can automate my specific workflows and applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access command settings THEN I SHALL be able to create new custom commands
2. WHEN I create a custom command THEN I SHALL be able to specify trigger phrases and actions
3. WHEN I test a custom command THEN the system SHALL allow me to verify it works correctly
4. WHEN I save a custom command THEN it SHALL be available immediately for voice recognition
5. WHEN I export custom commands THEN I SHALL be able to share them with other users

### Requirement 8: Application Integration

**User Story:** As a user of various Linux applications, I want voice commands that integrate well with common applications, so that I can control my workflow efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I'm using a file manager and say "go up" THEN the system SHALL navigate to the parent directory
2. WHEN I'm using a media player and say "play" or "pause" THEN the system SHALL control playback
3. WHEN I'm using a text editor and say "find" THEN the system SHALL open the find dialog
4. WHEN I'm using a terminal and say "clear" THEN the system SHALL clear the terminal
5. WHEN an application doesn't support a command THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback

### Requirement 9: Performance and Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a user, I want voice commands to execute quickly and responsively, so that voice control feels natural and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I speak a command THEN the system SHALL recognize it within 2 seconds
2. WHEN a command is recognized THEN it SHALL execute within 1 second
3. WHEN the system is processing THEN it SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
4. WHEN multiple commands are spoken quickly THEN the system SHALL queue them appropriately
5. WHEN the system is under load THEN command processing SHALL remain responsive

### Requirement 10: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle errors gracefully and help me recover from mistakes, so that voice control remains reliable and user-friendly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a command fails to execute THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message
2. WHEN I say "undo" after a command THEN the system SHALL attempt to reverse the action
3. WHEN the system misunderstands a command THEN I SHALL be able to correct it easily
4. WHEN an application is not available THEN the system SHALL suggest alternatives or installation
5. WHEN the system encounters an error THEN it SHALL continue functioning for other commands

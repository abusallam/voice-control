## Critical Path and Dependencies

### Must Complete First (Blocking Issues)
1. **Task 1.1-1.3**: Fix systemd service and installation - these are causing the system hangs
2. **Task 2.1-2.2**: Implement error handling and health monitoring - prevents crashes

### Can Be Done in Parallel
- **Task 3.1-3.2**: Voxtral research and implementation (independent of stability fixes)
- **Task 4.1-4.2**: System integration improvements (can be done alongside Voxtral work)

### Depends on Earlier Tasks
- **Task 3.3**: Speech recognition router (depends on 3.2 Voxtral backend)

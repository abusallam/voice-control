# Voice Control Stability & Voxtral Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines requirements for fixing critical stability issues in the voice control application and integrating Mistral's Voxtral Speech AI model. The current implementation has startup problems, system hangs, and requires machine restarts, which must be resolved while adding the new speech recognition backend.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: System Stability and Startup Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the voice control application to start reliably without causing system hangs or requiring machine restarts, so that I can use it consistently without system disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system boots THEN the voice control application SHALL start without causing system hangs or delays
2. WHEN the application encounters errors THEN it SHALL fail gracefully without requiring system restart
3. WHEN starting or stopping the application THEN it SHALL not interfere with other system processes
4. WHEN the application crashes THEN it SHALL clean up resources and allow immediate restart
5. WHEN dependencies are missing THEN the application SHALL provide clear error messages and continue with reduced functionality

### Requirement 2: Voxtral Speech Recognition Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use Mistral's Voxtral Speech AI model for better speech recognition accuracy and performance, so that I can have more reliable voice control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Voxtral is available THEN the system SHALL use it as the primary speech recognition engine
2. WHEN Voxtral fails to load THEN the system SHALL automatically fallback to Whisper
3. WHEN processing speech THEN Voxtral SHALL provide faster and more accurate recognition than Whisper
4. WHEN switching between models THEN the system SHALL allow runtime switching without restart
5. WHEN using Voxtral THEN the system SHALL maintain offline operation without internet dependency

### Requirement 3: Robust Service Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the voice control service to be properly managed by systemd with correct permissions and paths, so that it starts automatically and runs reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing the application THEN the systemd service SHALL be configured with correct paths and permissions
2. WHEN the service starts THEN it SHALL run under the correct user context with minimal privileges
3. WHEN the service fails THEN it SHALL restart automatically with exponential backoff
4. WHEN uninstalling THEN the service SHALL be properly removed without leaving system artifacts
5. WHEN the service is running THEN it SHALL not consume excessive system resources

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully and recover automatically from common issues, so that I don't experience system instability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio devices are unavailable THEN the system SHALL wait and retry with clear status messages
2. WHEN speech recognition fails THEN the system SHALL continue operating with fallback options
3. WHEN GUI components fail THEN the system SHALL maintain core functionality through CLI
4. WHEN system resources are low THEN the system SHALL reduce functionality rather than crash
5. WHEN configuration is corrupted THEN the system SHALL reset to defaults and continue operating

### Requirement 5: Improved Installation and Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want a reliable installation process that properly configures the system without causing conflicts or requiring manual fixes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing THEN the system SHALL detect and resolve dependency conflicts automatically
2. WHEN configuring services THEN the system SHALL use proper user permissions and paths
3. WHEN updating THEN the system SHALL preserve user configurations and custom settings
4. WHEN uninstalling THEN the system SHALL remove all components cleanly without system artifacts
5. WHEN installation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback options

### Requirement 6: Resource Management and Performance

**User Story:** As a user, I want the voice control application to use system resources efficiently without causing performance degradation or memory leaks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running continuously THEN the system SHALL maintain stable memory usage without leaks
2. WHEN processing audio THEN the system SHALL use CPU efficiently without blocking other processes
3. WHEN loading models THEN the system SHALL manage memory allocation to prevent system slowdown
4. WHEN idle THEN the system SHALL minimize resource usage while remaining responsive
5. WHEN under load THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical functions and degrade gracefully

### Requirement 7: Comprehensive Logging and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a user, I want detailed logging and diagnostic information to troubleshoot issues and understand system behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for troubleshooting
2. WHEN starting up THEN the system SHALL log initialization steps and any issues encountered
3. WHEN processing speech THEN the system SHALL log recognition confidence and timing metrics
4. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL log what was changed and by whom
5. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information and suggestions

### Requirement 8: Backward Compatibility and Migration

**User Story:** As a user with existing configurations, I want the upgraded system to preserve my settings and provide smooth migration to new features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN upgrading THEN the system SHALL preserve existing user configurations and custom commands
2. WHEN migrating to Voxtral THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing voice commands
3. WHEN new features are added THEN existing functionality SHALL continue to work unchanged
4. WHEN configuration format changes THEN the system SHALL automatically migrate old settings
5. WHEN rollback is needed THEN the system SHALL support reverting to previous stable configuration

### Requirement 9: Multi-Model Speech Recognition Architecture

**User Story:** As a user, I want the flexibility to choose between different speech recognition models based on my needs and system capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple models are available THEN the system SHALL allow easy switching between them
2. WHEN comparing models THEN the system SHALL provide performance and accuracy metrics
3. WHEN a model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL automatically use the best available alternative
4. WHEN configuring models THEN the system SHALL provide clear information about requirements and capabilities
5. WHEN models are updated THEN the system SHALL handle version changes gracefully

### Requirement 10: System Integration Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want confidence that the voice control system has been thoroughly tested and validated on my specific Linux configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing THEN the system SHALL run comprehensive compatibility tests
2. WHEN starting THEN the system SHALL validate all dependencies and configurations
3. WHEN running THEN the system SHALL continuously monitor for potential issues
4. WHEN problems are detected THEN the system SHALL provide specific remediation steps
5. WHEN system changes occur THEN the system SHALL re-validate compatibility automatically

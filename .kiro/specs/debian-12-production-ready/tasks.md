## Critical Path and Dependencies

### Must Complete First (Blocking Issues)
1. **Task 1.1-1.3**: Installation and startup fixes - these are causing the crashes
2. **Task 2.1**: Error handling framework - prevents system hangs
3. **Task 2.2**: Configuration management - ensures reliable startup

### High Priority (Production Readiness)
- **Task 2.3**: Health monitoring - prevents undetected failures
- **Task 3.1**: Speech recognition - core functionality
- **Task 4.1**: Resource management - prevents memory leaks

### Can Be Done in Parallel
- **Task 3.2-3.3**: Audio and input handling (independent of core fixes)
- **Task 5.1-5.2**: Documentation and diagnostics (independent development)
- **Task 6.1-6.3**: Testing (can start once core components are stable)

### Depends on Earlier Tasks
- **Task 4.2**: Performance monitoring (depends on 4.1 resource manager)
- **Task 6.2**: Stress testing (depends on 2.1 error handling)
- **Task 7.1-7.3**: Community preparation (depends on stable core)

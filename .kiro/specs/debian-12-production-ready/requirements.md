# Debian 12 Production-Ready Voice Control Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines requirements for making the voice control application production-ready specifically for Debian 12 (Bookworm) and the broader Linux community. The current implementation has critical stability issues including startup crashes, system hangs, and unreliable service management that prevent it from being a viable community contribution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Rock-Solid Stability and Reliability

**User Story:** As a Linux user, I want a voice control application that starts reliably every time and never causes system instability, so that I can confidently recommend it to others in the community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL initialize without causing system hangs or requiring machine restarts
2. WHEN the application encounters any error THEN it SHALL fail gracefully and continue operating with reduced functionality
3. WHEN running continuously for days THEN the application SHALL maintain stable memory usage without leaks or performance degradation
4. WHEN the system is under load THEN the application SHALL not interfere with other processes or cause system slowdown
5. WHEN dependencies are missing or incompatible THEN the application SHALL provide clear error messages and continue with available features

### Requirement 2: Debian 12 Specific Compatibility

**User Story:** As a Debian 12 user, I want the voice control application to work seamlessly with my system's specific packages, services, and configurations without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing on Debian 12 THEN the application SHALL work with system Python 3.11 and available packages
2. WHEN using PulseAudio or PipeWire THEN the application SHALL detect and work with the active audio system
3. WHEN running on Wayland or X11 THEN the application SHALL provide full functionality on both display servers
4. WHEN using systemd THEN the application SHALL integrate properly with Debian's systemd configuration
5. WHEN other applications use audio THEN the voice control SHALL coexist without conflicts

### Requirement 3: Bulletproof Installation and Service Management

**User Story:** As a user installing the application, I want a foolproof installation process that sets up everything correctly without requiring manual configuration or system-level changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the installation script THEN it SHALL complete successfully without requiring root privileges
2. WHEN the systemd service is installed THEN it SHALL use correct paths, permissions, and user context
3. WHEN the service starts THEN it SHALL initialize all components successfully or provide clear failure reasons
4. WHEN uninstalling THEN the application SHALL remove all components cleanly without leaving system artifacts
5. WHEN upgrading THEN the application SHALL preserve user settings and migrate configurations automatically

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Error Recovery and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a user experiencing issues, I want detailed diagnostic information and automatic recovery mechanisms so that I can resolve problems quickly or get help from the community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed diagnostic information for troubleshooting
2. WHEN audio devices become unavailable THEN the system SHALL wait and retry with clear status updates
3. WHEN speech recognition fails THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative methods and continue operating
4. WHEN configuration is corrupted THEN the system SHALL reset to working defaults and preserve user data
5. WHEN system resources are low THEN the system SHALL reduce functionality gracefully rather than crash

### Requirement 5: Modern Speech Recognition with Fallback

**User Story:** As a user, I want access to the latest speech recognition technology while maintaining reliability through proven fallback options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Voxtral is available THEN the system SHALL use it as the primary speech recognition engine
2. WHEN Voxtral fails to initialize THEN the system SHALL automatically fall back to Whisper without user intervention
3. WHEN switching between models THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent voice command functionality
4. WHEN processing speech THEN the system SHALL provide feedback on recognition confidence and accuracy
5. WHEN models are updated THEN the system SHALL handle version changes without breaking existing functionality

### Requirement 6: Community-Ready Documentation and Support

**User Story:** As a community member, I want comprehensive documentation and support resources so that I can install, use, and contribute to the project effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing THEN users SHALL have access to clear, step-by-step installation guides for Debian 12
2. WHEN troubleshooting THEN users SHALL find comprehensive guides covering common issues and solutions
3. WHEN contributing THEN developers SHALL have access to clear development setup and contribution guidelines
4. WHEN reporting issues THEN users SHALL have templates and guidelines for effective bug reporting
5. WHEN seeking help THEN users SHALL have multiple support channels and community resources available

### Requirement 7: Performance and Resource Efficiency

**User Story:** As a Linux user, I want the voice control application to be efficient with system resources and not impact the performance of other applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in the background THEN the application SHALL use minimal CPU and memory resources
2. WHEN processing speech THEN the application SHALL complete recognition within reasonable time limits
3. WHEN idle THEN the application SHALL reduce resource usage while maintaining responsiveness
4. WHEN multiple applications use audio THEN voice control SHALL not cause audio conflicts or delays
5. WHEN system resources are limited THEN the application SHALL adapt its resource usage accordingly

### Requirement 8: Security and Privacy Compliance

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious Linux user, I want assurance that my voice data remains local and the application follows security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing speech THEN all voice data SHALL remain on the local system without network transmission
2. WHEN storing configuration THEN the application SHALL use appropriate file permissions and secure storage
3. WHEN running as a service THEN the application SHALL operate with minimal required privileges
4. WHEN handling user data THEN the application SHALL follow Linux security best practices
5. WHEN updating THEN the application SHALL verify integrity and authenticity of updates

### Requirement 9: Extensibility and Customization

**User Story:** As an advanced user, I want to customize and extend the voice control application to meet my specific needs and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring commands THEN users SHALL be able to add custom voice commands easily
2. WHEN integrating with other tools THEN the application SHALL provide APIs and hooks for extensions
3. WHEN customizing behavior THEN users SHALL have access to comprehensive configuration options
4. WHEN scripting THEN the application SHALL support automation and integration with other Linux tools
5. WHEN developing plugins THEN developers SHALL have clear APIs and documentation for extensions

### Requirement 10: Long-term Maintainability and Community Support

**User Story:** As a community member, I want confidence that this project will be maintained and supported long-term with clear governance and contribution processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN contributing code THEN developers SHALL have clear coding standards and review processes
2. WHEN reporting bugs THEN issues SHALL be tracked and addressed in a timely manner
3. WHEN requesting features THEN there SHALL be a clear process for evaluation and implementation
4. WHEN the project evolves THEN backward compatibility SHALL be maintained for user configurations
5. WHEN seeking support THEN community members SHALL have access to active maintainers and contributors
